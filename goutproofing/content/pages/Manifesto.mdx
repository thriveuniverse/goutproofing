# Is it really possible to fully reverse gout with lifestyle alone, or is medication an unavoidable bridge?
## This is the million dollar question.
I fought this so hard, everything on line said to get the allopurinol and get back to living. But I didn’t want to be the person who had to take gout medicine, potentially for the rest of my life. It felt like I was some how accepting the “being old”, I didn’t want to grow into the image people have when they hear the word gout. 

For a man if we get grey hair, we can shave it off. If we get fat we can lose weight. These are seen as fashion statements, taking control – I couldn’t find that with taking gout medication, it just felt irreversible. 
## What do the statistic say? 
Honestly, they were not in my favour. The statistics are brutal: even among the most motivated patients, only 25–35 % manage to fully reverse gout with lifestyle alone. The rest hit a wall in the mid-6s and need medication to finish the job. And if you’re overweight and heading toward 60? Over half of us will end up with diabetes, gout, or both.

But that’s not fate — it’s the modern world.
## We are not doomed to a life of pill popping
Take my grandfather-in-law, my wife has often talked about him. I never had the chance to meet him but he sounds like quite a character, secretly smoked in his workshop, met his mates for a drink when the wives were organising the local flower shows. He  was 6 foot 2 had a physical job so was probably burning 3500-4500calories a day. He liked a drink, but beer was for the pub, he was always home for dinner (if occasionally a little late) and there was no beer or wine in the evenings at home. When he was stressed or needed to clear his head he went hiking up a mountain or did the gardening. He baked his own bread, but it was hearty brown bread that was eaten as a snack with healthy chunk of butter and a slathering of homemade jam (yes real jam made with sugar and a touch of lemon juice); it wasn’t a loaf a day it was more like  slice a day (or loaf a week). 

This lifestyle meant that he stayed lean, with constant low grade movement leading to excellent insulin sensitivity. His drinking was moderate, and afterwork, before eating and not everyday, no late night alcohol spikes. Yes, he had a Sunday roast of red meat, but the rest of the week was low purine, no liquid sugar, no seed oils and certainly no processed junk foods. 
He could drink beer, eat birthday cake and never had a screaming toe – society hadn’t dealt him the hand we have now. 

He broke none of the rules we now have to enforce — because those rules didn’t exist yet. They didn’t NEED these rules. Because in his world, the rules didn’t need to exist
## How did I get gout?
I confess to several things, I got overweight, I also drank too much Rosé wine. Both of these set me up for gout, then I injured my knee – and I could barely walk. I got really down, started drinking a bit more beer than usual, and also having a  whiskey before going to bed – it helped me sleep with the pain of my knee. So it was a perfect storm, reduced exercise, higher purines and lifestyle failures.

You know all those internet mems “ x does this, x does that – be like x”? 

My grandfather-in-laws name was Wallace, “be like Wallace”. 
## Why is Wallace important?
Wallace is the proof that gout is not a natural human state, that it is not how we are designed to be – and most importantly it is NOT how we have to live now. 
I am not spending a third of my life living incorrectly, perhaps if I was 80 I would take the medication – but I’m not. 
We got screwed over, born at the wrong time. We were born into a world that removed all the natural protections our grandfathers had — and then sold us the diseases as inevitable. 
Let’s change the odds, fight gout and “be like Wallace”. 

So that’s what we’re doing. 

•	Not accepting the pills-for-life sentence at 40. 

•	Not growing into the stereotype.

We’re going back to the way humans actually lived for thousands of years — real food, real movement, real moderation.
And if the numbers say we need a short bridge to get there faster, we’ll take it.
But the destination is the same: crystal-free, medication-free, living like Wallace and enjoying the good things that life offers.

## Be Like Wallace!
