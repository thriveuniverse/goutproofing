I'm a dad, husband, and businessman — and, more recently, a bit of a gout obsessive.

Until 2024, my wife and I were building [The Thrive Clan](https://thethriveclan.com) — a project using AI-powered research to help small and medium businesses adapt to rapid change without long-term consulting contracts. The idea was simple: give companies actionable, industry-specific insights they could buy once and run with — empowering them to future-proof themselves in the AI age.

Then gout hit.

My dad had it — he was overweight and enjoyed a whiskey. I thought I was safe. I wasn't. One Friday night I was fine; the next morning I couldn't stand on my foot. The pain was unlike anything I'd experienced.

Like most people, I turned to the internet for answers. What I found terrified me.

Every site screamed the same grim message:  
- Give up alcohol forever  
- Never eat anything you enjoy again  
- Take pills for life (and more pills to manage the side effects)  
- Lose weight fast — even though you can barely walk

It felt like a life sentence. I was depressed, angry, and lost.

The advice wasn't wrong — but it was delivered without empathy, without nuance, and without hope. It didn't meet me where I was.

So I started digging deeper — reading studies, talking to people who'd managed it well, experimenting (carefully), and tracking everything.

Slowly, things improved. I learned you *can* manage gout effectively without becoming a monk. You *can* keep enjoying life — beer, wine, whiskey included — with smart compromises.

That's why I built Gout Proofing.

This site is my way of passing on everything I've learned — the practical stuff, the evidence-based shortcuts, the mental side of dealing with flares — so you don't have to feel as alone or overwhelmed as I did.

I'm not a doctor. This isn't medical advice. But I *do* know how you feel, and I know it's possible to take back control.

If you're here because your foot feels like it's been hit with a hammer after a perfectly normal night — you're in the right place.

Welcome to the rebellion.
