Is Gout Curable? 

If you are reading this you or someone close to you has almost certainly been diagnosed with gout – then my first counsel is:  Stop, breathe and don’t panic! 

Gout is categorised as a disease. And we are always looking for cures to diseases, the news often reports on the great hope that we should have that a pharmaceutical answer is in sight – but with gout we need to think differently.

If you have gout then yes you have crystals and these crystals have lost their protective protein covering, the loss of this protein has put your body into a huge panic and this panic has made your toe or knee or wherever throb like a bastard and nearly made you scream in agony.

But if you have gout then there are possibly 60% of your friends who have gout in waiting, they have the crystals, if they are your friends you probably share some lifestyle factors, and for some reason your crystal protection broke first. These people are “gout pending”.

So is gout curable? Completely, if you change modern lifestyles. You probably think that I am being flippant or unhelpful, but you need to understand that you don’t need to be cured – you need to control the input into your system  so that your body can get back to where it actually wants to be, which means creating an environment where the crystals dissolve. 

You can get rid of all your crystals and you can stop more growing, but realistically you should be aiming to find a balance, a balance that allows you to enjoy life and keep the crystals levels low enough to keep their own counsel. 

So my answer is **_YES_** – you can solve your gout, this is not a new life state and it is not a life sentence.

This is my lived experience and what the evidence shows is possible for many, stay positive and have honest conversations (lots of them) with your doctor.
