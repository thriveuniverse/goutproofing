Yesterday I started this post, and luckily didn’t post it in its raw state (I am editing my brain download because it wasn’t suitable for publication) but when rereading it I realised the importance of some of the contents. 


There are some days when we are just tired and don’t want to do things, we want life to come to us and solve our problems. It flipping freezing in France at the moment and we had a bloody power cut – it knocked out a whole group of buildings so we were in the bar staying warm, the idea of sitting in a cold house with no electricity was not going to improve my mood. But there is still the issue of food. Next to the bar is a great kebab place – and the bar let people bring it in to eat there which is uber convenient – but gout brain kicked in and said _“you can’t eat that”_. A friend came to see me at the bar and bought a thank you gift for some help we had given last year and since I was feeling a bit down, my gout brain said _“you can’t drink that either”_ 


So when I wrote this post yesterday I wanted to scream from the building top “I fucking hate gout” 


Then my wife, ever the calm one – suggested taking my uric acid levels to reassure me how well things were going. And they weren’t going well, it was 9 – I haven’t been that high since the flare. We sat down analysed the day and realised that I had drunk almost no water all day. So it could be explained away and after some hydration to try and improve my mood she made me do another test – and sure enough it was a little lower at 8. This was supposed to make me feel in control and resettled – but it just made me angrier – “why do I have to prick my finger just to feel better and convince myself that my life is on track” 
During my pub visit, I fleetingly saw another friend who asked why I was on Perrier water and at the mention of gout announced he didn’t want to hear about it because it was way too scary. 


So my day was: 
-	Gout controls your drinking
-	Gout controls your eating 
-	Gout controls your social life 
-	You are forever pricking your fucking fingers to check if the uric acid is going to kill you off
-	Gout makes your friends panic
-	Gout is FUCKING horrible


Then I realised – and this is a really key point. I have been really good, I can have a glass of red wine, I can have a kebab, I can go without checking my bloods and I don’t need to let gout define me. 
What did it take for me to get to this realisation?  My wife said “you know you can have a glass of red if you want one?”  I was about to answer that I couldn’t face the  pain of a gout flare in this freezing cold weather, it was exactly that moment that I got it – I was so scared of getting gout that I was giving it all the power it in the world – I was giving it total control.


So fuck gout. I will live by the rules that keep me healthy, happy and still enjoy my life (these are the same rules that keep gout away) – but I am not going to be scared of it anymore. The whole point of these rules are to dissolve crystals so that rulebreaking days don’t give you gout – but you can still break the rules, that is built into the design.
When you have a bad day, and we all do, modern living is incredibly stressful don’t let the gout add to it. Yes, we live with gout but it mustn’t become a huge great scary monster – keep it in its place, outside of a flare, if you behave sensibly gout is just a pain in the arse.


Tonight  I have cooked a stir fry, a great low purine meal and to accompany I am having a glass of wine with my wife. No paddy attacks, no guilt (yes a jug of water is also laid on the table), there will be no blood tests tonight and only tomorrow after water in the usual manner, no checking for damage. Tonight gout, and fear, are not invited.


**_Just fuck gout… keep it in its place!_**


_It’s a pain in the arse on bad days, but it doesn’t get to sit at the table with us anymore._
